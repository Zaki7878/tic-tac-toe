# Tic Tac Toe in C++

This repository contains a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. It demonstrates basic game logic, user input handling, and the use of functions to create a playable game. The project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the fundamentals of C++ programming and game development.

## Features

- **Two-player mode:** Play against a friend on the same computer.
- **Simple UI:** Console-based user interface for easy interaction.
- **Game logic:** Handles win conditions, draws, and invalid moves.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-cpp.git
    cd tic-tac-toe-cpp
    ```
2. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    g++ -o tictactoe main.cpp
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```sh
    ./tictactoe
    ```

## How it Works

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the grid. The game ends when a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

## Code Overview

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main game loop, functions for drawing the board, handling player input, and checking game status.

## Future Improvements

- Add a single-player mode with AI.
- Implement a graphical user interface.
- Enhance input validation and error handling.
